CodePen.io homepage – landing page section replication
Coding Foundations Project exercise @ basque.devcamp.com

Demonstrate what you have learned about HTML and CSS by replicating the CodePen.io homepage – landing page section.

Include these elements: Navbar that includes "Pens, Projects, Posts, Collections, and Spark with a down chevron (does not need to actually dropdown). Images - use available tools to recreate colors, etc. Don't worry about replicating any functionality features such as drop-down, scrolling, etc. Simply replicate the landing page.

Once provided it has to be delivered through Github pages.
